# Data-Science
**Data science is the process of extracting knowledge and insigts from data by using scientific methods.Our favorite programming language is Python nowadays for DataScience. Python's - Pandas library has full functionalities for collecting and analyzing data. We use Anaconda to play with data and to create applications**
